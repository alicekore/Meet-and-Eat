### How to set up PostgreSQL (quick guide) ###

Until we set up a server for our DB we have to install everything locally. Therefore I also insert the password here visibly.
Use Version 10 or above. Make sure you also download the new settings.py.

##### Unix: #####

Download and install PostgreSQL and maybe pgAdmin for graphical interface.

Create DB via console:
```
$createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres meet_and_eat
```
Password should be set to 'postgres' by default.


PgAdmin:

1. Create new Server
2. Host: localhost
3. Port: 5432
4. User: postgres
5. Password: postgres
6. Name: meet_and_eat

##### Win: #####

1.Download PostgreSQL and open pgAdmin afterwards (comming with the installation)
2.Open pgAdmin
3.Create new DB/Server
4.Port:5432
5.Host: localhost
6.User: postgres
7.PAssword: postgres
8.Name: meet_and_eat

Afterwards you can access the DB via IntelliJ or DBeaver.
Make you you use 'python manage.py migrate' after adding a new model.

### Roles ###

**Admin as superuser**

### Dependencies ###

##### Django-select2 #####

Library: Installing 'Tag-Filter': 
In python console:
```
$pip install django_select2
```
##### Django-cleanup #####
```
$pip install django-cleanup
```
##### python-decouple #####
```
$pip install python-decouple
```

### Python Decouple and Environments ###
**Note:** you can still run the app with:  
`python manage.py runserver`  
python-decouple shouldn't affect the development process.  
python-decouple package provides an ability to set settings dynamic for different application environments. Some values in settings.py is set with python-decouple, the settings for different environments stored in /meeteat/meeteat/env
### Dockerisation ###
**Note:** you can still run the app with:  
`python manage.py runserver`  
Docker shouldn't affect the development process.  
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml let you run the app in the docker container. You need to have docker and docker-compose  
To build and run the containers run following commands in the folder with Dockerfile:  
  
`sudo docker-compose build`  
`sudo docker-compose up -d`  
  
You should be able to access application on 127.0.0.1:8000 after it.  
For debug purposes you can enter following commands:  
#Nginx  
`docker-compose logs nginx`  
#Web  
`docker-compose logs web`  
#DB  
`docker-compose logs db`  
You will see then logs of the corresponding containers  
**Note:** Email password is not in the docker config, because of security reasons. So if you want to test docker application set environment to development in the Dockerfile.
